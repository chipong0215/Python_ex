# That would work though it's faster to copy the underlying StyleArray: 

# c1 = ws['A1'] 
# c2 = ws['B2'] 

# c2._style = copy(c1._style) 

# However, what I am working on are NamedStyles. These represent styles that   
# are supposed to be shared just like the "Style Templates" in Excel. The   
# API will be something like this: 

# normal = NamedStyle(name="Normal", font=Font(â€¦), etc.) 
# wb.named_styles.add(normal) 

# ws['A1'].style = "Normal" 

# This would hopefully be easy to work with and also very fast. 

# However, there are a few implementation hurdles to jump: 

#         * named styles and cell formats are, according to the specification,   
# supposed to be commutative so that you could define a named style, apply   
# it to range of cells, change it, add local cell formats and everything   
# would look great. Except Excel explicitly doesn't follow the standard   
# here. Also it's not clear how to resolve possible conflicts. What do you   
# do when a cell font is bold but the named style has font.bold = False?.   
# This is particularly important if the style is supposed to mutable after   
# assignment. 

# The simplest implementation would do sort of what Excel does and copy the   
# attributes of the named style as well as maintaining a link to it but this   
# makes a lot of assumptions about use in code: a named style would need to   
# be immutable after being assigned once; existing cell formats would have   
# to be replaced en masse but could then be overwritten. Or resolution has   
# to be done when serialising the cell, which could slow things down a lot. 

# Also the code for the API is a bit tricky.
